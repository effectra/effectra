# Effectra PHP/MVC Framework

Effectra is a powerful PHP MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework designed to streamline the development process and provide a robust foundation for building web applications. With a folder structure similar to Laravel, Effectra offers a familiar environment for developers while providing additional features and improvements.

## Key Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Effectra follows the proven MVC pattern, separating the application into distinct layers for improved organization and maintainability.

- **Folder Structure**: The framework adopts a folder structure inspired by Laravel, making it easier for developers familiar with Laravel to transition to Effectra seamlessly.

- **Container**: Effectra provides a powerful container system that allows for efficient dependency management and inversion of control. It facilitates managing and resolving class dependencies effortlessly.

- **Provider**: The framework comes with a provider system that allows you to register and configure various services, including database connections, mailers, logging, and more. This modular approach promotes extensibility and code reuse.

- **Template Engine**: Effectra integrates a flexible template engine, allowing you to separate your presentation logic from the application's core functionality. This enables efficient design updates and enhances collaboration between designers and developers.

- **API Support**: Effectra offers built-in support for developing APIs, making it easy to create and manage web services. It includes features like request parsing, response formatting, and route handling specifically designed for API development.

- **Modeling**: The framework includes an intuitive modeling layer, simplifying the interaction with databases. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system that allows you to work with database tables as objects, making database operations more convenient and expressive.

- **Security Services**: Effectra prioritizes security and provides essential security services out of the box. These services include CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, token-based authentication, and other measures to help safeguard your application from common security threats.

## Getting Started

To get started with Effectra, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the Effectra repository or download the ZIP file from the official repository.

2. **Configuration**: Configure your web server to point to the public directory of the Effectra installation. Ensure that the required permissions are set correctly.

3. **Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using Composer, which is the recommended way to manage Effectra's dependencies.

4. **Routing**: Define your application's routes in the `web.php` or `api.php` file, located in the `routes` directory. Effectra uses a simple and expressive routing syntax to map URLs to controller actions.

5. **Controllers**: Create your controllers in the `app/Controllers` directory. Controllers handle the logic and flow of your application, interacting with models and rendering views.

6. **Models**: Define your models in the `app/Models` directory. Models encapsulate the interaction with the database, allowing you to perform CRUD operations and define relationships between tables.

7. **Views**: Create your views in the `view` directory. Views are responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying data from the controllers.

8. **Service Providers**: Register and configure your application's services in the `app/Providers` directory. Effectra's service providers allow you to manage various components of your application, such as database connections, mailers, and more.

9. **Start Developing**: With the initial setup complete, start developing your application using the powerful features and capabilities offered by Effectra.
